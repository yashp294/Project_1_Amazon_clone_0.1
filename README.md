# Amazon Clone

## Project Overview
This repository contains a front-end clone of the Amazon website. The project is built using HTML and CSS, replicating the layout and design of the original Amazon platform. Please note that this version is not responsive and is designed primarily for desktop viewing.

## Features
- **Navigation Menu**: A header with a navigation bar similar to Amazon’s, allowing users to explore different sections of the site.
- **Product Listings**: Display of products with images and prices, designed to mimic the look of Amazon’s product pages.
- **Static Layout**: The site is designed for desktop screens and does not include responsive features.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the elements on the webpage, ensuring visual appeal on desktop screens.
- `img/`: A directory containing all the images used in the project.

## How to View the Project
To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser on a desktop screen. The website should load correctly, displaying all the styled elements and images as intended.

## Future Improvements
- Implement responsive design to make the site adaptable to different screen sizes, including mobile and tablet devices.
- Add JavaScript functionality to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- Implement a backend to handle user authentication, product databases, and shopping cart functionality.
